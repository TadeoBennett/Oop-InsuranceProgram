# Oop-InsuranceProgram
A console object oriented program I started making at the start of the new year so that I can practice and challenge myself using linked lists, object arrays, maps, vectors, constructors and inheritance. Along the way I also learnt about dynamic cast(used) and static cast(was not used). By working on this project, I feel more comfortable looking at pointers in code.
